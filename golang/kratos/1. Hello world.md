# Golang Kratos Hello World

Kratos is a powerful and elegant framework written in Golang, developed by Bilibili, specifically designed for building microservices architectures following the Clean Architecture principles. It provides a clear separation of concerns across multiple layers: api → service → biz → data.

Kratos supports auto-generation of both gRPC and HTTP endpoints directly from Protobuf definitions, enabling consistent and efficient API development.

Out of the box, Kratos integrates a rich set of features essential for production-grade services, including:

* Distributed Tracing
* Structured Logging
* Metrics Collection
* Dynamic Configuration Management
* Service Discovery

By combining modern software engineering practices with Golang’s performance, Kratos empowers developers to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance microservices systems with minimal friction.

Open terminal and run <code>go install github.com/go-kratos/kratos/cmd/kratos/v2@latest</code>

Create Kratos application <code>kratos new hello-kratos</code>

Change working directory to <code>cd cmd/hello-kratos</code>

Run Kratos application <code>go run .</code> and open browser at <a href="http://localhost:8000/helloworld/Hello, Kratos!">localhost:8000/helloworld/Hello, Kratos!</a>

You can build the kratos application with <code>go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o ../../bin/release/hello-kratos</code>, use hello-kratos.exe if you are on Windows
